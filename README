This is my personal Ansible Playbook for provisioning my laptop(s)

I use Manjaro for my laptop, this should run fine on Arch ymmv

Step 1:
Install OS

Step 2:
Install Ansible and sync your config folders

Step 3:
Sync all of the Folders, the box for Automatic path's

Step 4:
Run this ansible playbook on itself
$ ansible-playbook main.yml --ask-become-pass

I would like to express that this is not necessarily the best way to use
Ansible and relies on some hacky things to make system config seperate from my
personal config. I like how it works
